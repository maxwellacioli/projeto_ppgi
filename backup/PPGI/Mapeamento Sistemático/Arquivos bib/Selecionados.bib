Researchers attempt to utilize the smallest possible set of relevant gene expression profiles in most gene expression studies to enhance tumor identification accuracy. This research aims to analyze and predicts colon cancer data employing a machine learning approach and feature selection technique based on a random forest classifier. More particularly, our proposed method can reduce the burden of high dimensional data and allow faster calculations by combining the “Mean Decrease Accuracy” and “Mean Decrease Gini” as feature selection methods into a renowned classifier namely Random Forest, with the aim of increasing the prediction model's accuracy level. In addition, we have also shown a comparative model analysis with selection of features and model without selection of features. The extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model with feature selection is favorable and effective which triumphs the best performance of accuracy.},

abstract = {Early detection of breast cancer plays crucial role in planning and result of associated treatment. The purpose of this article is threefold: (i) to investigate whether or not clinical features obtained using routine blood analysis combined with anthropometric measurements can be utilized for envisaging breast cancer using predictive machine learning techniques; (ii) to explore the role of various machine learning components such as feature selection, data division protocols and classification to determine suitable biomarkers for breast cancer prediction; and (iii) to evaluate a recent database of clinical and anthropometric measurements acquired from normal individuals and individuals suffering from breast cancer. A database consisting of anthropometric and clinical attributes is used in the experiments. Various feature selection and statistical significance analysis methods are used to determine the relevance of various features. Furthermore, popular classifiers such as kernel based support vector machine (SVM), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayesian, linear discriminant, quadratic discriminant, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and random forest were implemented and evaluated for breast cancer risk prediction using these features. Results of feature selection techniques indicate that among the nine features considered in this study, glucose, age and resistin are found to be most relevant and effective biomarkers for breast cancer prediction. Further, when these three features are used for classification, the medium K-NN classifier achieves the highest classification accuracy of 92.105{\%} followed by medium Gaussian SVM which achieves classification accuracy of 83.684{\%} under hold out data division protocol.},

abstract = {Background
Understanding of molecular mechanism, lying beneath the carcinogenic expression, is very essential for early and accurate detection of the disease. It predicts various types of irregularities and results in effective drug selection for the treatment. Pathway information plays an important role in mapping of genotype information to phenotype parameters. It helps to find co-regulated gene groups whose collective expression is strongly associated with the cancer development.
Method
In this paper, we have proposed a bi-stage hierarchical swarm based gene selection technique which combines two methods, proposed in this paper for the first time. First one is a multi-fitness discrete particle swarm optimization (MFDPSO) based feature selection procedure, having multiple fitness functions. This technique uses multi-filtering based gene selection procedure. On top of it, a new blended Laplacian artificial bee colony algorithm (BLABC) is proposed and it is used for automatic clustering of the selected genes obtained from the first procedure. We have performed 10 times 10-fold cross validation and compared our proposed method with various statistical and swarm based gene selection techniques for different popular cancer datasets.
Result
Experimental results show that the proposed method as a whole performs significantly well. The MFDPSO based system in combination with BLABC generates a good subset of pathway markers which provides more effective insight into the gene-disease association with high accuracy and reliability.},

abstract = {Advances in the gene sequencing technology and the outbreak of artificial intelligence have made precision medicine a reality recently. Applying machine learning algorithms to cancer prediction using gene expression data helps to discover the link between genetic data and cancer, which will promote the development and application of precision medicine. Considering the natural order of genes, a new classification method that combines fused lasso and elastic net as regularization for linear support vector machine (SVM), which uses huberized hinge loss as the loss function, is proposed in this paper, which we name it oriented feature selection SVM (OFSSVM). Due to the characteristics of the elastic net and fused lasso, the OFSSVM can not only provide automatic feature selection, but also average the adjacent coefficients, resulting in a sparse and smooth solution. We demonstrate its effectiveness in both binary classification and multiclass classification in the sense of comprehensive evaluation that not only the classification accuracy but also the interpretability are considered. The experiments show that the OFSSVM is an appealing compromise between interpretability and classification accuracy, and is superior to other traditional methods in the sense of comprehensive evaluation.},

Reliability, efficiency and accuracy of the model depends upon the choice of strong and relevant features. However, feature selection is always a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we have proposed an approach where we combine a clustering technique and a stochastic technique to select effective features from the high dimensional breast cancer data set in quick time. In order to select strong and relevant features, we have used an improved version of K-means algorithm called fast K-means algorithm, which is much faster and more accurate than a general means algorithm. The fast K-means algorithm is embedded in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to produce better results. The results were validated using various classification techniques and were evaluated on various performance evaluation measures. The results obtained were found to be highly supportive in nature. The feature subset generated using PSO based fast K-means algorithm on KDDcup 2008 data set produced an accuracy of 99.39{\%} and its time complexity was found to be O(log(k)).},

abstract = {In machine learning and data mining, feature selection aims to seek a compact and discriminant feature subset from the original feature space. It is usually used as a preprocessing step to improve the prediction performance, understandability, scalability, and generalization capability of classifiers. A typical gene microarray data set has the characteristics of high dimensionality, limited samples, and most irrelevant features, and these characteristics make it difficult to discover a compact set of features that really contribute to the response of the model. In this paper, a score-based criteria fusion feature selection method (SCF) is proposed for cancer prediction, and this method aims at improving the prediction performance of the classification model. The SCF method is evaluated on five open gene microarray data sets and three low-dimensional data sets, and it shows superior performance over many well-known feature selection methods when employing two classifiers SVM and KNN to measure the quality of selected features. Experiments verify that SCF is able to find more discriminative features than the competing methods and can be used as a preprocessing algorithm to combine with other methods effectively.},

abstract = {Most cancers at early stages show no obvious symptoms and curative treatment is not an option any more when cancer is diagnosed. Therefore, making accurate predictions for the risk of early cancer has become urgently necessary in the field of medicine. In this paper, our purpose is to fully utilize real-world routine physical examination data to analyze the most discriminative features of cancer based on ReliefF algorithm and generate early risk predictive model of cancer taking advantage of three machine learning (ML) algorithms. We use physical examination data with a return visit followed 1 month later derived from CiMing Health Checkup Center. The ReliefF algorithm selects the top 30 features written as Sub(30) based on weight value from our data collections consisting of 34 features and 2300 candidates. The 4-layer (2 hidden layers) deep neutral network (DNN) based on B-P algorithm, the support machine vector with the linear kernel and decision tree CART are proposed for predicting the risk of cancer by 5-fold cross validation. We implement these criteria such as predictive accuracy, AUC-ROC, sensitivity and specificity to identify the discriminative ability of three proposed method for cancer. The results show that compared with the other two methods, SVM obtains higher AUC and specificity of 0.926 and 95.27{\%}, respectively. The superior predictive accuracy (86{\%}) is achieved by DNN. Moreover, the fuzzy interval of threshold in DNN is proposed and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DNN is 90.20{\%}, 94.22{\%} and 93.22{\%}, respectively, using the revised threshold interval.

abstract = {Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality across the globe. Approximately 9.6 million people are estimated to have died due to cancer disease in 2019. Accurate and early prediction of cancer can assist healthcare professionals to devise timely therapeutic innervations to control sufferings and the risk of mortality. Generally, a machine learning (ML) based predictive system in healthcare uses data (genetic profile or clinical parameters) and learning algorithms to predict target values for cancer detection. However, optimization of predictive accuracy is an important endeavor for accurate decision making. Reject Option (RO) classifiers have been used to improve the predictive accuracy of classifiers for cancer like complex problems. In a gene profile all of the features are not important and should be shaved off. ML offers different techniques with their own methodology for feature selection (FS) and the classification results are dependent on the datasets each having its own distribution and features. Therefore, both FS methods and ML algorithms with RO need to be considered for robust classification. The main objective of this study is to optimize three parameters (learning algorithm, FS method and rejection rate) for robust cancer prediction rather than considering two traditional parameters (learning algorithm and rejection rate). The analysis of different FS methods (including t-test, Las Vegas Filter (LVF), Relief, and Information Gain (IG)) and RO classifiers on different rejection thresholds is performed to investigate the robust predictability of cancer. The three cancer datasets (Colon cancer, Leukemia and Breast cancer) were reduced using different FS methods and each of them were used to analyze the predictability of cancer using different RO classifiers. The results reveal that for each dataset predictive accuracies of RO classifiers were different for different FS methods. The findings based on proposed scheme indicate that, the ML algorithms along with their dependence on suitable FS methods need to be taken into consideration for accurate prediction.},

However, signatures originating from different studies often suffer from poor robustness when used in the classification of data sets independent from which they were generated from. In this paper, we present an unsupervised feature learning framework by integrating a principal component analysis algorithm and autoencoder neural network to identify different characteristics from gene expression profiles. As the foundation for the obtained features, an ensemble classifier based on the AdaBoost algorithm (PCA-AE-Ada) was constructed to predict clinical outcomes in breast cancer. During the experiments, we established an additional classifier with the same classifier learning strategy (PCA-Ada) in order to perform as a baseline to the proposed method, where the only difference is the training inputs. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve index, Matthews correlation coefficient index, accuracy, and other evaluation parameters of the proposed method were tested on several independent breast cancer data sets and compared with representative gene signature-based algorithms including the baseline method.

abstract = {The symptoms of cancer normally appear only in the advanced stages, so it is very hard to detect resulting in a high mortality rate among the other types of cancers. Thus, there is a need for early prediction of lung cancer for the purpose of diagnosing and this can result in better chances of it being able to be treated successfully. Histopathology images of lung scan can be used for classification of lung cancer using image processing methods. The features from lung images are extracted and employed in the system for prediction. Grey level co-occurrence matrix along with the methods of Gabor filter feature extraction are employed in this investigation. Another important step in enhancing the classification is feature selection that tends to provide significant features that helps differentiating between various classes in an accurate and efficient manner. Thus, optimal feature subsets can significantly improve the performance of the classifiers. In this work, a novel algorithm of feature selection that is wrapper-based is proposed by employing the modified stochastic diffusion search (SDS) algorithm. The SDS, will benefit from the direct communication of agents in order to identify optimal feature subsets. The neural network, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and the decision tree have been used for classification. The results of the experiment prove that the proposed method is capable of achieving better levels of performance compared to existing methods like minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and correlation-based feature selection.},

abstract = {Cancer data sets contains many details of patient information, out of which only a few attributes contribute in predicting the accurate stage of cancer. Certain attributes of the entire data set play a major role in deciding the type of cancer i.e. whether benign or malignant hence feature selection techniques are useful in such scenarios for retaining the relevant feature set. Moreover, in order to achieve our goal of predicting the accurate stage of cancer, we need an appropriate model which generally results in higher accuracy and ensemble model proves to be the best model for such scenarios. In this study, we are using the existing ensemble techniques along with a combination of supervised machine learning algorithms to develop a new model for breast cancer prediction. We are also using feature selection techniques to enhance the performance of the ensemble model. For this purpose, machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistics Regression and feature selection techniques like Variance threshold and f-test have been taken into consideration. To achieve higher accuracy for the ensemble model, bagging, boosting and stacking techniques are used.},

abstract = {Medical errors are considered as the leading cause of death and injury. Breast cancer becomes one of the leading causes of death among women, not only in the Philippines but worldwide. In this paper, data mining was used to predict the stage of breast cancer using a hybrid of fuzzy logic and decision tree. This aims to help experts to make decisions rather than replacing them. The result will only give an expert a recommendation, but the final decision is still on the hands of the experts. Feature selection was used to determine the best attribute in the dataset from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). The data set consists of incidence from 1975 to 2016, but the study limits the analysis from 2010 to 2016. Different cleaning and preprocessing of data are conducted. After thorough preprocessing of data, six (6) attributes are selected, and one (1) target class. Performance comparison shows that the fuzzy decision tree achieved a higher accuracy of 99.96{\%}, sensitivity of 99.26{\%} and specificity of 99.98{\%} than the decision tree classification technique. The simulation result shows a correctly classified instance of 165,124, which is equivalent to 99.97{\%} and only 351 incorrect classified instances or 0.21{\%}. Thus, a fuzzy decision tree is more robust than the traditional decision tree classifier for predicting the stage of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Cancer research is one of the major and significant areas in medical research. A substantial number of research has been performed in this area and several methods have been employed. However, accuracy of cancer prediction is yet to reach near perfection as the conventional classification methods have several limitations. In recent times, microarray processed gene expression data has been used to predict cancer with significant accuracy. The gene expression data are usually high dimensional and comprises of relatively small number of samples which makes them difficult to classify. In order to achieve higher accuracy, ensembles method can be deployed which combines multiple classification methods. In this study, we have used the public colon cancer gene expression data set that consists of 62 instances having 2,000 attributes. An adaptive pre-processing procedure has been conducted including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to cope up with the high dimensionality of the data. This was followed by building an ensemble learning model with k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Kernel Support Vector Machines (KSVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Bayes Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Comparing with other classifiers, this study offers a significant improvement as our ensemble learning model gives higher accuracy than previously employed classification techniques. Thus the obtained accuracy is 91.67{\%} with the scores 0.75, 1.00 and 0.85 of precision, recall and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values respectively.},

abstract = {Cancer is a deadly disease all over the world and its morbidity is increasing at an alarming rate in recent years. With the rapid development of computer science and machine learning technologies, computer-aid cancer prediction has achieved increasingly progress. DNA methylation, as an important epigenetic modification, plays a vital role in the formation and progression of cancer, and therefore can be used as a feature for cancer identification. In this study, we introduce a convolutional neural network based multi-model ensemble method for cancer prediction using DNA methylation data. We first choose five basic machine learning methods as the first stage classifiers and conduct prediction individually. Then, a convolutional neural network is used to find the high-level features among the classifiers and gives a credible prediction result. Experimental results on three DNA methylation datasets of Lung Adenocarcinoma, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma show the proposed ensemble method can uncover the intricate relationship among the classifiers automatically and achieve better performances.},

abstract = {The intensive explosion in the generation of large scale cancer gene expression data brought several computational challenges, yet opened great opportunities in exploring different pathways in order to improve cancer prognosis, diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we propose a targeted unsupervised learning model, based on deep autoencoders (TAE) to learn significant cancer representation based on the gene expression omnibus(GEO) integrated expO data set, for the ultimate goal of constructing an accurate cancer stage predictive model. Where, the trained model was tested on two gene expression cancer data sets namely, lung cancer for clinical stage and intensive breast cancer (IBC) for pathological stage. In which, the model extracted new features space for the two cancer type based on the knowledge built from the expO data set. The generated features were used to train classifiers to predict the cancer stage of each sample. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposal by comparison to the principal component analysis (PCA) unsupervised dimensionality reduction, as well as to the supervised univariate features selection method. The experimental results, show a promising performance of our analysis model to build a collaborative knowledge from different cancer type to enhance the prediction rate of different cancer stage.},

abstract = {Cancer is one of main non-communicable diseases. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a type of white blood cancer, is one of the most common pediatric cancers. Analysis of cancer prognosis is necessary to determine the proper treatment for each patient. However, cancer data analysis is challenging because multiple risk factors may influence the prognosis of cancer, including gene and clinical condition of patient. This study aims to develop prediction model for cancer prognosis using clinical and gene expression (microarray) data. In this research, manifold learning is applied to microarray data to reduce its dimension, then two Deep Belief Network (DBN) models for both clinical and microarray data are trained separately. Probabilities obtained from Clinical DBN model and Microarray DBN model are integrated using softmax nodes on Bayesian Network structure. Based on various experiments, the best integration model obtained is DBN+BN 32 with prediction accuracy 84.2{\%} for 2-years survival, 70.2{\%} for 3-years, 68.4{\%} for 4-years, and 73.7{\%} for 5-years. This prediction model can be used in cancer analysis and help doctor to decide proper treatment for patient.},

abstract = {Utilizing historical clinical datasets to guide future treatment choices is  beneficial for patients and physicians. Machine learning and feature selection algorithms (namely, Fisher's discriminant ratio, Kruskal-Wallis' analysis, and Relief-F) have been combined in this research to analyse a SEER database containing clinical features from de-identified thyroid cancer patients. The data covered 34 unique clinical variables such as patients' age at diagnosis or information regarding lymph nodes, which were employed to build various novel classifiers to distinguish patients that lived for over 10 years since diagnosis, from those who did not survive at least five years. By properly optimizing supervised neural networks, specifically multilayer perceptrons, using data from large groups of thyroid cancer patients (between 6,756 and 20,344 for different models), we demonstrate that unspecialized and existing medical recording can be reliably turned into power of prediction to help doctors make informed and optimized treatment decisions, as distinguishing patients in terms of prognosis has been achieved with 94.5{\%} accuracy. We also envisage the potential of applying our machine learning strategy to other diseases and purposes such as in designing clinical trials for unmasking the maximum benefits and minimizing risks associated with new drug candidates on given populations.},
