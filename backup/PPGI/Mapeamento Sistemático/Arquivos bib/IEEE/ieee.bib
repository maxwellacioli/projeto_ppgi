abstract={Breast cancer is the first female cancer responsible for high mortality worldwide. Despite the progress that has made it possible to better understand the mechanisms of cancer development, the causes of breast cancer are currently unknown. Nevertheless, studies have identified some risk factors that promote breast cancer and a healthy lifestyle can reduce risk. In Morocco, breast cancer is the first cancer in women. It represents 34.3% of all female cancers. In this work, the Fast Correlation-Based Feature selection (FCBF) method is used to filter irrelevant and redundant characteristics in order to improve the quality of cancer classification, and we will provide an overview of the evolution of key data in the health system and apply five learning algorithms to a breast cancer data set. The purpose of this research work is to predict breast cancer, using several machine-learning algorithms that are Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors K-NN, and Multilayer Perception MLP, in order to select the most effective algorithm with and without FCBF. The experimental results show that SVM gives the highest accuracy of 97.9% without FCBF but if we apply this method we find that the SVM and MLP show the best results in comparison with other algorithms. The results will help to choose the best learning algorithm machine classification for breast cancer prediction.},

title={On the Feature Selection Methods and Reject Option Classifiers for Robust Cancer Prediction},

abstract={Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality across the globe. Approximately 9.6 million people are estimated to have died due to cancer disease in 2019. Accurate and early prediction of cancer can assist healthcare professionals to devise timely therapeutic innervations to control sufferings and the risk of mortality. Generally, a machine learning (ML) based predictive system in healthcare uses data (genetic profile or clinical parameters) and learning algorithms to predict target values for cancer detection. However, optimization of predictive accuracy is an important endeavor for accurate decision making. Reject Option (RO) classifiers have been used to improve the predictive accuracy of classifiers for cancer like complex problems. In a gene profile all of the features are not important and should be shaved off. ML offers different techniques with their own methodology for feature selection (FS) and the classification results are dependent on the datasets each having its own distribution and features. Therefore, both FS methods and ML algorithms with RO need to be considered for robust classification. The main objective of this study is to optimize three parameters (learning algorithm, FS method and rejection rate) for robust cancer prediction rather than considering two traditional parameters (learning algorithm and rejection rate). The analysis of different FS methods (including t-test, Las Vegas Filter (LVF), Relief, and Information Gain (IG)) and RO classifiers on different rejection thresholds is performed to investigate the robust predictability of cancer. The three cancer datasets (Colon cancer, Leukemia and Breast cancer) were reduced using different FS methods and each of them were used to analyze the predictability of cancer using different RO classifiers. The results reveal that for each dataset predictive accuracies of RO classifiers were different for different FS methods. The findings based on proposed scheme indicate that, the ML algorithms along with their dependence on suitable FS methods need to be taken into consideration for accurate prediction.},

abstract={In machine learning and data mining, feature selection aims to seek a compact and discriminant feature subset from the original feature space. It is usually used as a preprocessing step to improve the prediction performance, understandability, scalability, and generalization capability of classifiers. A typical gene microarray data set has the characteristics of high dimensionality, limited samples, and most irrelevant features, and these characteristics make it difficult to discover a compact set of features that really contribute to the response of the model. In this paper, a score-based criteria fusion feature selection method (SCF) is proposed for cancer prediction, and this method aims at improving the prediction performance of the classification model. The SCF method is evaluated on five open gene microarray data sets and three low-dimensional data sets, and it shows superior performance over many well-known feature selection methods when employing two classifiers SVM and KNN to measure the quality of selected features. Experiments verify that SCF is able to find more discriminative features than the competing methods and can be used as a preprocessing algorithm to combine with other methods effectively.},

abstract={Features are the most important entity in any data mining and machine learning applications. They are the backbone of any model. Reliability, efficiency and accuracy of the model depends upon the choice of strong and relevant features. However, feature selection is always a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we have proposed an approach where we combine a clustering technique and a stochastic technique to select effective features from the high dimensional breast cancer data set in quick time. In order to select strong and relevant features, we have used an improved version of K-means algorithm called fast K-means algorithm, which is much faster and more accurate than a general means algorithm. The fast K-means algorithm is embedded in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to produce better results. The results were validated using various classification techniques and were evaluated on various performance evaluation measures. The results obtained were found to be highly supportive in nature. The feature subset generated using PSO based fast K-means algorithm on KDDcup 2008 data set produced an accuracy of 99.39% and its time complexity was found to be O(log(k)).},

abstract={Advances in the gene sequencing technology and the outbreak of artificial intelligence have made precision medicine a reality recently. Applying machine learning algorithms to cancer prediction using gene expression data helps to discover the link between genetic data and cancer, which will promote the development and application of precision medicine. Considering the natural order of genes, a new classification method that combines fused lasso and elastic net as regularization for linear support vector machine (SVM), which uses huberized hinge loss as the loss function, is proposed in this paper, which we name it oriented feature selection SVM (OFSSVM). Due to the characteristics of the elastic net and fused lasso, the OFSSVM can not only provide automatic feature selection, but also average the adjacent coefficients, resulting in a sparse and smooth solution. We demonstrate its effectiveness in both binary classification and multiclass classification in the sense of comprehensive evaluation that not only the classification accuracy but also the interpretability are considered. The experiments show that the OFSSVM is an appealing compromise between interpretability and classification accuracy, and is superior to other traditional methods in the sense of comprehensive evaluation.},

abstract={Medical / Clinical data mining attracted many researchers to work in that area. Bio medical engineers, computer scientists, analytic professionals are involved in such research area to develop an outcome which is nothing but a decision support system. Gastric cancer is one of the deadliest diseases that have more potential research scope. Only few research articles are published on gastric cancer prediction using computing and analytics. This research paper aims to propose an adaptive feature selection method based on particle swarm optimization for gastric cancer prediction. Performance metrics such as accuracy, hit rate and time taken for classification are taken into account for comparing the proposed AFS-PSO with the existing algorithms. 1127 real-time patients' records were obtained and the implementation of AFS-PSO is carried out using MATLAB and the results portray that AFS-PSO outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of accuracy, hit rate and elapsed time.},

abstract={In many microarray studies, classifiers have been constructed based on gene signatures to predict clinical outcomes for various cancer sufferers. However, signatures originating from different studies often suffer from poor robustness when used in the classification of data sets independent from which they were generated from. In this paper, we present an unsupervised feature learning framework by integrating a principal component analysis algorithm and autoencoder neural network to identify different characteristics from gene expression profiles. As the foundation for the obtained features, an ensemble classifier based on the AdaBoost algorithm (PCA-AE-Ada) was constructed to predict clinical outcomes in breast cancer. During the experiments, we established an additional classifier with the same classifier learning strategy (PCA-Ada) in order to perform as a baseline to the proposed method, where the only difference is the training inputs. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve index, Matthews correlation coefficient index, accuracy, and other evaluation parameters of the proposed method were tested on several independent breast cancer data sets and compared with representative gene signature-based algorithms including the baseline method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method using deep learning techniques performs better than others.},

abstract={Most cancers at early stages show no obvious symptoms and curative treatment is not an option any more when cancer is diagnosed. Therefore, making accurate predictions for the risk of early cancer has become urgently necessary in the field of medicine. In this paper, our purpose is to fully utilize real-world routine physical examination data to analyze the most discriminative features of cancer based on ReliefF algorithm and generate early risk predictive model of cancer taking advantage of three machine learning (ML) algorithms. We use physical examination data with a return visit followed 1 month later derived from CiMing Health Checkup Center. The ReliefF algorithm selects the top 30 features written as Sub(30) based on weight value from our data collections consisting of 34 features and 2300 candidates. The 4-layer (2 hidden layers) deep neutral network (DNN) based on B-P algorithm, the support machine vector with the linear kernel and decision tree CART are proposed for predicting the risk of cancer by 5-fold cross validation. We implement these criteria such as predictive accuracy, AUC-ROC, sensitivity and specificity to identify the discriminative ability of three proposed method for cancer. The results show that compared with the other two methods, SVM obtains higher AUC and specificity of 0.926 and 95.27%, respectively. The superior predictive accuracy (86%) is achieved by DNN. Moreover, the fuzzy interval of threshold in DNN is proposed and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of DNN is 90.20%, 94.22% and 93.22%, respectively, using the revised threshold interval. The research indicates that the application of ML methods together with risk feature selection based on real-world routine physical examination data is meaningful and promising in the area of cancer prediction.},

abstract={Breast cancer is a major threat for middle aged women throughout the world and currently this is the second most threatening cause of cancer death in women. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death. An important fact regarding breast cancer prognosis is to optimize the probability of cancer recurrence. This paper aims at finding breast cancer recurrence probability using different data mining techniques. We also provide a noble approach in order to improve the accuracy of those models. Cancer patient's data were collected from Wisconsin dataset of UCI machine learning Repository. This dataset contained total 35 attributes in which we applied Naive Bayes, C4.5 Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms and calculated their prediction accuracy. An efficient feature selection algorithm helped us to improve the accuracy of each model by reducing some lower ranked attributes. Not only the contributions of these attributes are very less, but their addition also misguides the classification algorithms. After a careful selection of upper ranked attributes we found a much improved accuracy rate for all three algorithms.},

Microarray technology provides a promising approach of exploiting gene profiles for cancer diagnosis.

The authors use two gene selection methods to extract the significant lung cancer related genes, and accordingly propose different GEP-based prediction models. Prediction performance evaluations and comparisons between the authors' GEP models and three representative machine learning methods, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function neural network, were conducted thoroughly on real microarray lung cancer datasets. Reliability was assessed by the cross-data set validation. The experimental results show that the GEP model using fewer feature genes outperformed other models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. It is concluded that GEP model is a better solution to lung cancer prediction problems.},
