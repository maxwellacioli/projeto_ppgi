AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cancer is a complex worldwide health problem associated 
      with high mortality. With the rapid development of the high-throughput sequencing 
      technology and the application of various machine learning methods that have emerged 
      in recent years, progress in cancer prediction has been increasingly made based on 
      gene expression, providing insight into effective and accurate treatment decision 
      making. Thus, developing machine learning methods, which can successfully 
      distinguish cancer patients from healthy persons, is of great current interest. 
      However, among the classification methods applied to cancer prediction so far, no 
      one method outperforms all the others. METHODS: In this paper, we demonstrate a new 
      strategy, which applies deep learning to an ensemble approach that incorporates 
      multiple different machine learning models. We supply informative gene data selected 
      by differential gene expression analysis to five different classification models. 
      Then, a deep learning method is employed to ensemble the outputs of the five 
      classifiers. RESULTS: The proposed deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method 
      was tested on three public RNA-seq data sets of three kinds of cancers, Lung 
      Adenocarcinoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma and Breast Invasive Carcinoma. The test 
      results indicate that it increases the prediction accuracy of cancer for all the 
      tested RNA-seq data sets as compared to using a single classifier or the majority 
      voting algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: By taking full advantage of different classifiers, 
      the proposed deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method is shown to be accurate 
      and effective for cancer prediction.
