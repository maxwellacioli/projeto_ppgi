abstract = {Lung cancer is the most prevailing source of death due to cancer, accounting for over 25% of death in the United States. Being able to predict the survival time for patients will provide valuable information for the choice of their treatment plans and benefit patient management. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing, many high-throughput sequencing data for DNA and RNA becomes available for cancer patients. Here we present the results for using multiple machine learning algorithms in predicting the survivorship of patients with Lung cancer adenocarcinoma. Using the publicly available datasets in TCGA with the overall survival length, and transcriptomic information, we evaluated our ability to predict prognosis. We found that using the expression level of a few candidate genes alone generates significant statistical power from a very limited number of patients, suggesting more future studies to be conducted on collecting such data to facilitate personalized medicine.},

abstract = {Breast Cancer has turned into a typical disease around the globe and harvesting the life of young women and the main source of cancer death and caused 22.9% of a wide range of cancers in women. The development of massive breast cancer screening has led to earlier diagnosis and rapid management with a significant improvement in survival rate. The problem of automatically searching for information contained in medical images is urgently needed. In order to process this large volume of information, doctors are currently turning to the use of Machine Learning (ML) systems to assist in the analysis and interpretation of these images. In this paper, we have conducted an experimental study for three major ML algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify Brest cancer. The experiments were conducted on WDBC dataset to obtain the best algorithms in term of accuracy. Finally, identify the most specific and relevant attributes of the malignant tumour classification through more than one feature selection algorithms.},

abstract = {Cancer is a deadly disease all over the world and its morbidity is increasing at an alarming rate in recent years. With the rapid development of computer science and machine learning technologies, computer-aid cancer prediction has achieved increasingly progress. DNA methylation, as an important epigenetic modification, plays a vital role in the formation and progression of cancer, and therefore can be used as a feature for cancer identification. In this study, we introduce a convolutional neural network based multi-model ensemble method for cancer prediction using DNA methylation data. We first choose five basic machine learning methods as the first stage classifiers and conduct prediction individually. Then, a convolutional neural network is used to find the high-level features among the classifiers and gives a credible prediction result. Experimental results on three DNA methylation datasets of Lung Adenocarcinoma, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma show the proposed ensemble method can uncover the intricate relationship among the classifiers automatically and achieve better performances.},

However, the samples of gene features involve lots of noises in a realistic environment. In this study, we present a random forest with self-paced learning bootstrap for improvement of lung cancer classification and prognosis based on gene expression data. To be specific, we propose an ensemble learning with random forest approach to improving the model classification performance by selecting multi-classifiers. Then, we investigate the sampling strategy by gradually embedding from high- to low-quality samples by self-paced learning. The experimental results based on five public lung cancer datasets show that our proposed method could select significant genes exactly, which improves classification performance compared to that of existing approaches. We believe that our proposed method has the potential to assist doctors in gene selections and lung cancer prognosis.},

abstract = {Medical errors are considered as the leading cause of death and injury. Breast cancer becomes one of the leading causes of death among women, not only in the Philippines but worldwide. In this paper, data mining was used to predict the stage of breast cancer using a hybrid of fuzzy logic and decision tree. This aims to help experts to make decisions rather than replacing them. The result will only give an expert a recommendation, but the final decision is still on the hands of the experts. Feature selection was used to determine the best attribute in the dataset from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). The data set consists of incidence from 1975 to 2016, but the study limits the analysis from 2010 to 2016. Different cleaning and preprocessing of data are conducted. After thorough preprocessing of data, six (6) attributes are selected, and one (1) target class. Performance comparison shows that the fuzzy decision tree achieved a higher accuracy of 99.96%, sensitivity of 99.26% and specificity of 99.98% than the decision tree classification technique. The simulation result shows a correctly classified instance of 165,124, which is equivalent to 99.97% and only 351 incorrect classified instances or 0.21%. Thus, a fuzzy decision tree is more robust than the traditional decision tree classifier for predicting the stage of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Cancer is the main public health issue in most places of the world due to the difficulties in its early diagnosis and to begin early treatment. In the recent years many techniques have been proposed to tackle the high dimensionality in cancer datasets. This paper proposed a membrane-inspired feature selection method to utilize the potentials of membrane computing features such as decentralization, non-determinism, and maximal parallel computing for feature selection of cancer data. Kernel p system- one of the variants of membrane computing- is defined based on multi objective binary particle swarm optimization feature selection method through nine steps involving definitions of objects, compartments, rules and output. Matlab software is used to model the proposed approach. The proposed model evaluated by cell line data of breast cancer with six samples of papillary infiltrating ductal carcinoma and Carcinosarcoma disease state. As the initial attempt to come out with a model, division rule and sequential computation on Matlab are used as tools to define potential of membrane computing in trading space against time computation. The evaluation results indicate the proposed model based on kernel p system computation with distributed compartments is capable in distinguishing marker genes.},

abstract = {Cancer research is one of the major and significant areas in medical research. A substantial number of research has been performed in this area and several methods have been employed. However, accuracy of cancer prediction is yet to reach near perfection as the conventional classification methods have several limitations. In recent times, microarray processed gene expression data has been used to predict cancer with significant accuracy. The gene expression data are usually high dimensional and comprises of relatively small number of samples which makes them difficult to classify. In order to achieve higher accuracy, ensembles method can be deployed which combines multiple classification methods. In this study, we have used the public colon cancer gene expression data set that consists of 62 instances having 2,000 attributes. An adaptive pre-processing procedure has been conducted including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to cope up with the high dimensionality of the data. This was followed by building an ensemble learning model with k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Kernel Support Vector Machines (KSVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Bayes Generalized Linear Model (GLM). Comparing with other classifiers, this study offers a significant improvement as our ensemble learning model gives higher accuracy than previously employed classification techniques. Thus the obtained accuracy is 91.67% with the scores 0.75, 1.00 and 0.85 of precision, recall and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values respectively.},

The generated features were used to train classifiers to predict the cancer stage of each sample. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposal by comparison to the principal component analysis (PCA) unsupervised dimensionality reduction, as well as to the supervised univariate features selection method. The experimental results, show a promising performance of our analysis model to build a collaborative knowledge from different cancer type to enhance the prediction rate of different cancer stage.},

abstract = {Ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm which leverages a collection of diverse base learners to achieve better prediction performance than that could be achieved by any individual base learner. This work proposes an evolutionary feature subspaces generation based ensemble learning framework, which formulates the tasks of searching for the most suitable feature subspace for each base learner into a multi-task optimization problem and solve it via an evolutionary multi-task optimizer. Multiple such problems which correspond to different base learners are solved simultaneously via an evolutionary multi-task feature selection algorithm such that solving one problem may help solve some other problems via implicit knowledge transfer. The quality of thus generated feature subspaces is supposed to outperform those obtained by individually seeking the optimal feature subspace for each base learner. We implement the proposed framework by using SVM, KNN, and decision tree as the base learners, proposing a multi-task binary particle swarm optimization algorithm for evolutionary multi-task feature selection, and utilizing the major voting scheme to combine the outputs of the base learners. Experiments on several UCI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Analysis of cancer prognosis is necessary to determine the proper treatment for each patient. However, cancer data analysis is challenging because multiple risk factors may influence the prognosis of cancer, including gene and clinical condition of patient. This study aims to develop prediction model for cancer prognosis using clinical and gene expression (microarray) data. In this research, manifold learning is applied to microarray data to reduce its dimension, then two Deep Belief Network (DBN) models for both clinical and microarray data are trained separately. Probabilities obtained from Clinical DBN model and Microarray DBN model are integrated using softmax nodes on Bayesian Network structure. Based on various experiments, the best integration model obtained is DBN+BN 32 with prediction accuracy 84.2% for 2-years survival, 70.2% for 3-years, 68.4% for 4-years, and 73.7% for 5-years. This prediction model can be used in cancer analysis and help doctor to decide proper treatment for patient.},

abstract = {Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may help some breast cancer patients with subsequent surgery or radiotherapy. However, there are certain risks associated with NAC. To lower the risks, machine-learning methods can be used to assist the diagnosis of breast tumors based on clinical data. This study investigated the use of ensemble machine-learning models in the prediction of pathological response to NAC for breast cancer patients with actual clinical data. The ensemble k-nearest neighbor (EKNN) model was determined to predict pathological responses. The imbalanced clinical data of patients with NAC were reviewed retrospectively, and 11 clinicopathological variables were selected from all features to establish succinct EKNN model. A total of 259 patients' clinical data was included in the model. The training and testing set for each single k-nearest neighbor (KNN) contained 27 and 9 patients, respectively. A total of 259 breast cancer patients in the database included 36 cases of pathological complete response, 157 cases of partial response, and 66 cases of stable disease. To solve the imbalanced clinical data problem, an ensemble-learning EKNN was designed, where the number of samples for each class in a base learner is set to equal to the minimum number 36. It showed that the classification accuracy of pathological response for breast cancer patients after NAC was 81.48% by EKNN model and the Kappa coefficient was 0.72, indicating that the robustness and generalization were better than the average prediction ability of single KNN model (average accuracy of single KNN model was 62.22% and Kappa coefficient was 0.43). Based on actual clinical data, important clinicopathological variables are selected, and the imbalanced problem are well solved by the ensemble EKNN model. The model improved the robustness and generalization for predicting the pathological response with imbalanced clinical data. It suggested that ensemble machine learning has possible practical applications for assisting cancer stage diagnoses and precision medicine.},

abstract = {Background: MicroRNAs miRNAs are approximately 22-nucleotide long regulatory RNA that mediate RNA interference by binding to cognate mRNA target regions. Here, we present a distributed kernel SVM-based binary classification scheme to predict miRNA targets. It captures the spatial profile of miRNA-mRNA interactions via smooth B-spline curves. This is accomplished separately for various input features, such as thermodynamic and sequence-based features. Further, we use a principled approach to uniformly model both canonical and non-canonical seed matches, using a novel seed enrichment metric. Finally, we verify our miRNA-mRNA pairings using an Elastic Net-based regression model on TCGA expression data for four cancer types to estimate the miRNAs that together regulate any given mRNA. Results: We present a suite of algorithms for miRNA target prediction, under the banner Avishkar, with superior prediction performance over the competition. Specifically, our final kernel SVM model, with an Apache Spark backend, achieves an average true positive rate TPR of more than 75 percent, when keeping the false positive rate of 20 percent, for non-canonical human miRNA target sites. This is an improvement of over 150 percent in the TPR for non-canonical sites, over the best-in-class algorithm. We are able to achieve such superior performance by representing the thermodynamic and sequence profiles of miRNA-mRNA interaction as curves, devising a novel seed enrichment metric, and learning an ensemble of miRNA family-specific kernel SVM classifiers. We provide an easy-to-use system for large-scale interactive analysis and prediction of miRNA targets. All operations in our system, namely candidate set generation, feature generation and transformation, training, prediction, and computing performance metrics are fully distributed and are scalable. Conclusions: We have developed an efficient SVM-based model for miRNA target prediction using recent CLIP-seq data, demonstrating superior performance, evaluated using ROC curves for different species human or mouse, or different target types canonical or non-canonical. We analyzed the agreement between the target pairings using CLIP-seq data and using expression data from four cancer types. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first distributed framework for miRNA target prediction based on Apache Hadoop and Spark. Availability: All source code and sample data are publicly available at https://bitbucket.org/cellsandmachines/avishkar. Our scalable implementation of kernel SVM using Apache Spark, which can be used to solve large-scale non-linear binary classification problems, is available at https://bitbucket.org/cellsandmachines/kernelsvmspark.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions PPIs play a vital role in the biological processes involved in the cell functions and disease pathways. The experimental methods known to predict PPIs require tremendous efforts and the results are often hindered by the presence of a large number of false positives. Herein, we demonstrate the use of a new Genetic Programming GP based Symbolic Regression SR approach for predicting PPIs related to a disease. In this case study, a dataset consisting of 135 PPI complexes related to cancer was used to construct a generic PPI predicting model with good PPI prediction accuracy and generalization ability. A high correlation coefficient CC magnitude of 0.893, and low root mean square error RMSE, and mean absolute percentage error MAPE values of 478.221 and 0.239, respectively, were achieved for both the training and test set outputs. To validate the discriminatory nature of the model, it was applied on a dataset of diabetes complexes where it yielded significantly low CC values. Thus, the GP model developed here serves a dual purpose: a a predictor of the binding energy of cancer related PPI complexes, and b a classifier for discriminating PPI complexes related to cancer from those of other diseases.},
