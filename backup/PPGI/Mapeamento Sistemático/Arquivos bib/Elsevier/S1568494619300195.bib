abstract = "Prostate cancer is a highly incident malignant cancer among men. Early detection of prostate cancer is necessary for deciding whether a patient should receive costly and invasive biopsy with possible serious complications. However, existing cancer diagnosis methods based on data mining only focus on diagnostic accuracy, while neglecting the interpretability of the diagnosis model that is necessary for helping doctors make clinical decisions. To take both accuracy and interpretability into consideration, we propose a stacking-based ensemble learning method that simultaneously constructs the diagnostic model and extracts interpretable diagnostic rules. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is devised to maximize the classification accuracy and minimize the ensemble complexity for model selection. As for model combination, a random forest classifier-based stacking technique is explored for the integration of base learners, i.e., decision trees. Empirical results on real-world data from the General Hospital of PLA demonstrate that the classification performance of the proposed method outperforms that of several state-of-the-art methods in terms of the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the results reveal that several diagnostic rules extracted from the constructed ensemble learning model are accurate and interpretable."
