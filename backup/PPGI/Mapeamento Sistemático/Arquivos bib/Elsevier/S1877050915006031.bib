abstract = "Cancer is a crucial disease which kills the people worldwide. To reduce cancer death rate is to detect it earlier. It depends upon the age, blood group, food habits, genetic combination, and heredity. Even though predicting cancer is generally clinical and biological in nature, in general we used some of the computation methods and artificial intelligence to predict breast cancer through images and rough set values.In this paper we are using revised edition of classifier (i.e) Mahout Naive Bayes and the performance and accuracy can be calculated"
