abstract = "Many fields such as data science, data mining suffered from the rapid growth of data volume and high data dimensionality. The main problems which are faced by these fields include the high computational cost, memory cost, and low accuracy performance. These problems will occur because these fields are mainly used machine learning classifiers. However, machine learning accuracy is affected by the noisy and irrelevant features. In addition, the computational and memory cost of the machine learning is mainly affected by the size of the used datasets. Thus, to solve these problems, feature selection can be used to select optimal subset of features and reduce the data dimensionality. Feature selection represents an important preprocessing step in many intelligent and expert systems such as intrusion detection, disease prediction, and sentiment analysis. An improved version of Salp Swarm Algorithm (ISSA) is proposed in this study to solve feature selection problems and select the optimal subset of features in wrapper-mode. Two main improvements were included into the original SSA algorithm to alleviate its drawbacks and adapt it for feature selection problems. The first improvement includes the use of Opposition Based Learning (OBL) at initialization phase of SSA to improve its population diversity in the search space. The second improvement includes the development and use of new Local Search Algorithm with SSA to improve its exploitation. To confirm and validate the performance of the proposed improved SSA (ISSA), ISSA was applied on 18 datasets from UCI repository. In addition, ISSA was compared with four well-known optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm, and Ant Lion Optimizer. In these experiments four different assessment criteria were used. The rdemonstrate that ISSA outperforms all baseline algorithms in terms of fitness values, accuracy, convergence curves, and feature reduction in most of the used datasets. The wrapper feature selection mode can be used in different application areas of expert and intelligent systems and this is confirmed from the obtained results over different types of datasets."
