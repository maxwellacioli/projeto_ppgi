abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in women worldwide.  Many studies have been conducted to predict the survival indicators, however most of these analyses were predominantly performed using basic statistical methods. As an alternative, this study used machine learning techniques to build models for detecting and visualising significant prognostic indicators of breast cancer survival rate. METHODS: A large hospital-based breast cancer dataset retrieved from the University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (n = 8066) with diagnosis information between 1993 and 2016 was used in this study. The dataset contained 23 predictor variables and one dependent variable, which referred to the survival status of the patients (alive or dead). In determining the significant prognostic factors of breast cancer survival rate, prediction models were built using decision tree, random forest, neural networks, extreme boost, logistic regression, and support vector machine. Next, the dataset was clustered based on the receptor status of breast cancer patients identified via immunohistochemistry to perform advanced modelling using random forest. Subsequently, the important variables were ranked via variable selection methods in random forest. Finally, decision trees were built and validation was performed using survival analysis. RESULTS: In terms of both model accuracy and calibration measure, all algorithms produced close outcomes, with the lowest obtained from decision tree (accuracy = 79.8{\%}) and the highest from random forest (accuracy = 82.7{\%}). The important variables identified in this study were cancer stage classification, tumour size, number of total axillary lymph nodes removed, number of positive lymph nodes, types of primary treatment, and methods of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Interestingly the various machine learning algorithms used in this study yielded close accuracy hence these methods could be used as alternative predictive tools in the breast cancer survival studies, particularly in the Asian region. The important prognostic factors influencing survival rate of breast cancer identified in this study, which were validated by survival curves, are useful and could be translated into decision support tools in the medical domain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Survivability rates vary widely among various stages of breast cancer.  Although machine learning models built in past to predict breast cancer survivability were given stage as one of the features, they were not trained or evaluated separately for each stage. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there are differences in performance of machine learning models trained and evaluated across different stages for predicting breast cancer survivability. METHODS: Using three different machine learning methods we built models to predict breast cancer survivability separately for each stage and compared them with the traditional joint models built for all the stages. We also evaluated the models separately for each stage and together for all the stages. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the most suitable model to predict survivability for a specific stage is the model trained for that particular stage. In our experiments, using additional examples of other stages during training did not help, in fact, it made it worse in some cases. The most important features for predicting survivability were also found to be different for different stages. By evaluating the models separately on different stages we found that the performance widely varied across them. We also demonstrate that evaluating predictive models for survivability on all the stages together, as was done in the past, is misleading because it overestimates performance.},

abstract = {Objectives: Radiologists face uncertainty in making decisions based on their  judgment of breast cancer risk. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have been widely applied in detection/recognition of cancer. This study aimed to establish a model to aid radiologists in breast cancer risk estimation. This incorporated imaging methods and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for cyto-pathological diagnosis. Methods: An artificial neural network (ANN) technique was used on a retrospectively collected dataset including mammographic results, risk factors, and clinical findings to accurately predict the probability of breast cancer in individual patients. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were used to evaluate discriminative performance. Result: The network incorporating the selected features performed best (AUC = 0.955). Sensitivity and specificity of the ANN were respectively calculated as 0.82 and 0.90. In addition, negative and positive predictive values were respectively computed as 0.90 and 0.80. Conclusion: ANN has potential applications as a decision-support tool to help underperforming practitioners to improve the positive predictive value of biopsy recommendations.},

abstract = {Accurate cancer patient prognosis stratification is essential for oncologists to  recommend proper treatment plans. Deep learning models are capable of providing good prediction power for such stratification. The main challenge is that only a limited number of labeled patients are available for cancer prognosis. To overcome this, we proposed Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-based Deep Adversarial Data Augmentation (wDADA) that leverages generative adversarial networks to perform data augmentation and assist in model training. We used the proposed framework to train our model for predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) of breast cancer patients from the METABRIC dataset. We found that wDADA achieved 0.6726± 0.0278, 0.7538±0.0328, and 0.6507 ±0.0248 in terms of accuracy, AUC, and concordance index in predicting 5-year DSS, respectively, which is comparable to our previously proposed Bimodal model (accuracy: 0.6889±0.0159; AUC: 0.7546± 0.0183; concordance index: 0.6542±0.0120), which needs careful calibration and extensive search on pre-trained network architectures. The flexibility of the proposed wDADA allows us to incorporate it with ensemble learning and semi-supervised learning to further improve performance. Our results indicate that it is possible to utilize generative adversarial networks to train deep models in medical applications, wherein only limited data are available.},

abstract = {Breast cancer (BC), as one of the leading causes of death among women, comprises  several subtypes with controversial and poor prognosis. Considering the TNM (tumor, lymph node, metastasis) based classification for staging of breast cancer, it is essential to diagnose the disease at early stages. The present study aims to take advantage of the systems biology approach on genome wide gene expression profiling datasets to identify the potential biomarkers involved at stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV as well as in the integrated group. Three HER2-negative breast cancer microarray datasets were retrieved from the GEO database, including normal, stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV samples. Additionally, one dataset was also extracted to test the developed predictive models trained on the three datasets. The analysis of gene expression profiles to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed after preprocessing and normalization of data. Then, statistically significant prioritized DEGs were used to construct protein-protein interaction networks for the stages for module analysis and biomarker identification. Furthermore, the prioritized DEGs were used to determine the involved GO enrichment and KEGG signaling pathways at various stages of the breast cancer. The recurrence survival rate analysis of the identified gene biomarkers was conducted based on Kaplan-Meier methodology. Furthermore, the identified genes were validated not only by using several classification models but also through screening the experimental literature reports on the target genes. Fourteen (21 genes), nine (17 genes), eight (10 genes), four (7 genes), and six (8 genes) gene modules (total of 53 unique genes out of 63 genes with involving those with the same connectivity degree) were identified for stage I, stage II, stage III, stage IV, and the integrated group. Moreover, SMC4, FN1, FOS, JUN, and KIF11 and RACGAP1 genes with the highest connectivity degrees were in module 1 for abovementioned stages, respectively. The biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions were demonstrated for outcomes of GO analysis and KEGG pathway assessment. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 33 genes were found to be significant while considering the recurrence-free survival rate as an alternative to overall survival rate. Furthermore, the machine learning calcification models show good performance on the determined biomarkers. Moreover, the literature reports have confirmed all of the identified gene biomarkers for breast cancer. According to the literature evidence, the identified hub genes are highly correlated with HER2-negative breast cancer. The 53-mRNA signature might be a potential gene set for TNM based stages as well as possible therapeutics with potentially good performance in predicting and managing recurrence-free survival rates at stages I, II, III, and IV as well as in the integrated group. Moreover, the identified genes for the TNM-based stages can also be used as mRNA profile signatures to determine the current stage of the breast cancer.},

abstract = {Similarities between stem cells and cancer cells have implicated mammary stem cells  in breast carcinogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that normal breast stem cells exist in multiple phenotypic states: epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M). Hybrid E/M cells in particular have been implicated in breast cancer metastasis and poor prognosis. Mounting evidence also suggests that stem cell phenotypes change throughout the life course, for example, through embryonic development and pregnancy. The goal of this study was to use single cell RNA-sequencing to quantify cell state distributions of the normal mammary (NM) gland throughout developmental stages and when perturbed into a stem-like state in vitro using conditional reprogramming (CR). Using machine learning based dataset alignment, we integrate multiple mammary gland single cell RNA-seq datasets from human and mouse, along with bulk RNA-seq data from breast tumors in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), to interrogate hybrid stem cell states in the normal mammary gland and cancer. CR of human mammary cells induces an expanded stem cell state, characterized by increased expression of embryonic stem cell associated genes. Alignment to a mouse single-cell transcriptome atlas spanning mammary gland development from in utero to adulthood revealed that NM cells align to adult mouse cells and CR cells align across the pseudotime trajectory with a stem-like population aligning to the embryonic mouse cells. Three hybrid populations emerge after CR that are rare in NM: KRT18+/KRT14+ (hybrid luminal/basal), EPCAM+/VIM+ (hybrid E/M), and a quadruple positive population, expressing all four markers. Pseudotime analysis and alignment to the mouse developmental trajectory revealed that E/M hybrids are the most developmentally immature. Analyses of single cell mouse mammary RNA-seq throughout pregnancy show that during gestation, there is an enrichment of hybrid E/M cells, suggesting that these cells play an important role in mammary morphogenesis during lactation. Finally, pseudotime analysis and alignment of TCGA breast cancer expression data revealed that breast cancer subtypes express distinct developmental signatures, with basal tumors representing the most "developmentally immature" phenotype. These results highlight phenotypic plasticity of normal mammary stem cells and provide insight into the relationship between hybrid cell populations, stemness, and cancer.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The death rate of breast tumour is falling as there is progress in its  research area. However, it is the most common disease among women. It is a great challenge in designing a machine learning model to evaluate the performance of the classification of breast tumour. METHODS: Implementing an efficient classification methodology will support in resolving the complications in analyzing breast cancer. This proposed model employs two machine learning (ML) algorithms for the categorization of breast tumour; Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm is used for the breast tumour classification. RESULT: This classification includes the two levels of disease as benign or malignant. These two machine learning algorithms are verified using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset after feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The comparison of these two ML algorithms is done using the standard performance metrics. CONCLUSION: The comparative analysis results indicate that the KNN classifier outperforms the result of the decision-tree classifier in the breast cancer classification.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}.},
