abstract = {Identifying biomarkers for better diagnosis or prognosis of breast cancer is in demand but presents many challenges. In this study, we introduced a data-integration approach to identify sub-network biomarkers capable of predicting breast cancer treatment outcomes including disease-free survival, and overall survival at five years and long-term. A gene expression data is used for evaluating the predictive power of sub-networks of genes, while the protein-protein interaction network is to guide the search for the candidate sub-networks. To reduce the search space, we proposed a score to estimate the predictive ability of a set of genes, thus, only the candidates with the high score are evaluated by Support Vector Machine classifier during the search. After the sub-networks with highest classification performance were selected for all seed genes, they were further analyzed with pathway data and cancer-related genes from literature for their biological meaning. The selected sub-networks yielded highly accurate and contain genes associated with many cancer pathways, including breast cancer.},

abstract = {Data mining or Data Analytics is a set of techniques that allows to analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information. It is the process of finding correlations or patterns in large historical datasets. It can be applied in almost any field ranging from business to education, then to medicine. Data mining has been increasingly used in medicine, especially in oncology. Breast cancer (BC) becomes the most common cancer among females worldwide and the leading cause of death in developed countries. Many studies have attempted to apply Data mining techniques to detect survivability of cancers in human beings. This paper aims to perform a systematic mapping study to analyze and synthesize studies on the application of Data mining techniques in breast cancer. 403 articles published between 2000 and 2016 were therefore selected and analyzed according to five criteria: year and channel of publication, research type, medical task, empirical type and DM techniques. Results show that conferences and journals are the most publication venues, researchers were more interested in applying DM techniques for diagnosis of BC, historical based evaluation was the empirical type of studies most used in the evaluation of DM techniques in BC, and classification was the most investigated task of DM in BC.},

abstract = {Predicting the statistics of survival from the innumerable reports of breast cancer is a difficult job to perform, one that every researcher tackles in the field of medicals science. Since the birth stages of the related research, many new techniques have advanced. This point is evident from the groundbreaking biomedical technologies and discovery of better self-explanatory predictive factors. Due to supply of cheaper computer hardware and easy availability of software technologies, large amount of qualitative data is being stored automatically. The developed ways of analyzing huge data quantities have bestowed upon this field efficient and effective means of processing. Five renowned data mining algorithms (Naive Bayes classification, decision trees, IBK, support vector machine (using SMO) and OneR,) were used for our prediction models applied to a substantiate dataset (more than 683cases). The10-fold cross-validation method was also taken into due consideration to determine the prediction accuracy of the five prognostic designs in comparing their credibility. Through a sensitivity analysis of support vector machines, we were able to gauge the prioritized importance of predictive factors in this work.},

abstract = {Cancer progression is a dynamic process that involves a wide spectrum of changes in expression levels for multiple genes. Increasing amount of data has been collected for patients, such as genome, transcriptome, prognosis, and histology images of the tumor. While previous studies have used mostly mutation profiles miRNA and ctRNA for cancer prognosis, we are interested in evaluating the use of expression levels of candidate genes in cancer prognosis. We used gene expression of 45 candidate genes in breast cancer as an example and showed the effectiveness of using such multivariate expression data in cancer prognosis to predict 5-year survivorship. Applying machine learning techniques, we were able to predict survivorship from expression data alone without incorporating any other information. Our example study urges such expression data to be collected for patients by hospitals, research institutes in the future.},

abstract = {Big data are everywhere nowadays. Many businesses possess big data for their success because big data are very useful and are considered as new oil. For instance, big data are very important in predicting the trends on what will happen in the future. Many researchers have generated or gathered data to further enhance their research and to apply them to numerous real-life applications. Examples of big data include healthcare patient data. To improve the detection of illnesses and diseases, researchers have gathered healthcare patient data, examined the diagnosis on healthcare patient data (e.g., cells, blood count, antibodies count), and compared with previous data to determine if a specific illness or disease exist. Having an automatic predictive method for healthcare and disease analytics would be desirable. In this paper, we focus on healthcare mining, which aims to computationally discover knowledge from healthcare data. In particular, we present a data science framework with two predictive analytic algorithms for accurate prediction on the trends of cancer cases. The algorithms predict cancerous cells based on the information of the cell data from some data samples. Evaluation results on several real-life datasets related to the breast cancer demosntrate the effectiveness of our data science framework and predictive algorithms in healthcare data analytics.},

abstract = {Aberrant changes to interactions among cellular components have been conjectured to be potential causes of abnormalities in cellular functions. By systematic analysis of high-throughput-omics data, researchers hope to detect potential associations among measured variables for better biomarker identification and phenotype prediction. In this paper, we focus on the methods to measure pairwise interactive effects among continuous random variables, representing molecular expressions, with respect to a given categorical outcome. Together with a comprehensive review on the existing measures, we further propose new measures that better estimate interactive effects, especially in small sample size scenarios. We first evaluate the performance of the existing and new methods for both small and large sample sizes based on simulated datasets that shows our proposed methods outperform previous methods in general. The best performing method for small sample size scenarios suggested by simulation experiments is then implemented to estimate interactive effects among genes with respect to the metastasis outcome in two breast cancer studies based on micro-array gene expression datasets. Our results further demonstrate that integrating detected interactive effects together with individual effects can help in finding more accurate biomarkers for breast cancer metastasis, which are indeed involved in important pathways related to cancer metastasis based on gene set enrichment analysis.},

abstract = {Condition-specific modules in multiple networks must be determined to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms of diseases. Current algorithms exhibit limitations such as low accuracy and high sensitivity to the number of networks because these algorithms discover condition-specific modules in multiple networks by separating specificity and modularity of modules. To overcome these limitations, we characterize condition-specific module as a group of genes whose connectivity is strong in the corresponding network and weak in other networks; this strategy can accurately depict the topological structure of condition-specific modules. We then transform the condition-specific module discovery problem into a clustering problem in multiple networks. We develop an efficient heuristic algorithm for the Specific Modules in Multiple N etworks SMMN, which discovers the condition-specific modules by considering multiple networks. By using the artificial networks, we demonstrate that SMMN outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In breast cancer networks, stage-specific modules discovered by SMMN are more discriminative in predicting cancer stages than those obtained by other techniques. In pan-cancer networks, cancer-specific modules are more likely to associate with survival time of patients, which is critical for cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Different types of genomic aberration may simultaneously contribute to tumorigenesis. To obtain a more accurate prognostic assessment to guide therapeutic regimen choice for cancer patients, the heterogeneous multi-omics data should be integrated harmoniously, which can often be difficult. For this purpose, we propose a Gene Interaction Regularized Elastic Net GIREN model that predicts clinical outcome by integrating multiple data types. GIREN conveniently embraces both gene measurements and gene-gene interaction information under an elastic net formulation, enforcing structure sparsity, and the “grouping effect” in solution to select the discriminate features with prognostic value. An iterative gradient descent algorithm is also developed to solve the model with regularized optimization. GIREN was applied to human ovarian cancer and breast cancer datasets obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas, respectively. Result shows that, the proposed GIREN algorithm obtained more accurate and robust performance over competing algorithms LASSO, Elastic Net, and Semi-supervised PCA, with or without average pathway expression features in predicting cancer progression on both two datasets in terms of median area under curve AUC and interquartile range IQR, suggesting a promising direction for more effective integration of gene measurement and gene interaction information.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play crucial roles in a variety of biological processes and complex diseases. Massive studies have indicated that lncRNAs interact with related proteins to exert regulation of cellular biological processes. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to determine lncRNA-protein interaction by experiment, more accurate predictions of interaction by computational methods are imperative. We propose a novel computational approach, predicting lncRNA-protein interaction using graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (LPGNMF), to discover unobserved lncRNA-protein association. First, we calculate lncRNA similarity and protein similarity by integrating the lncRNA expression information and gene ontology information. Subsequently, we utilize graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization framework to predict potential interactions for all lncRNA simultaneously. In the cross validation test, LPGNMF achieves an AUC of 85.2 percent, higher than those of other compared methods. In addition, novel lncRNA-protein interactions detected by LPGNMF are validated by literatures or database. The results indicate that our method is effective to discover potential lncRNA-protein interaction.},
