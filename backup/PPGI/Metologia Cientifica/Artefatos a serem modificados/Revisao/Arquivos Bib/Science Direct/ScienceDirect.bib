abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is one of the major death causing diseases of the women in the world. Every year more than million women are diagnosed with breast cancer more than half of them will die because of inaccuracies and delays in diagnosis of the disease. High accuracy in cancer prediction is important to improve the treatment quality and the survivability rate of patients. Objectives: In this paper, we are going to propose a new and robust breast cancer prediction and diagnosis system based on the Rough Set (RS). Also, introducing the robust classification process based on some new and most effective attributes. Comparing and evaluating the performance of our proposed approach with the clinical, Radial Basis Function, and Artificial Neural Networks classification schemes. Methods: The dataset used in our experiments consists of 60 samples obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Egypt. We have used the RS theory to robustly find dependence relationships among data, and evaluate the importance of attributes through: •Applying the Approximation Sets on this dataset to identify the patient's cancer stage (0, IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, IV); and•Running the Reduction process on this dataset to identify which attributes (symptoms) are most effective for description and predict breast cancer stage. Results: •Our approach has classified the patients into 9 different stages, Stage 0 with accuracy 75{\%}, Stage IA with accuracy 71{\%}, Stage IB with zero patients, Stage IIA with accuracy 86{\%}, Stage IIB with accuracy 67.5{\%}, Stage IIIA with accuracy 85{\%}, Stage IIIB with accuracy 100{\%}, Stage IIIC with zero patients, and Stage IV with accuracy 100{\%};•The Reduction process gives as output, the most effective symptoms to early predict and accurately diagnosis the breast cancer. That are represented in Lymph Node Status, Tumor Size, Estrogen Receptor Status, Progesterone Receptor Status, and Metastasis; and•The last but not least, we have found two patients (patient No. 11 and 51 from our dataset) in High Risk Status, which requires intensive and special treatment. Conclusion: We have introduced the robustness of the RS theory in early predicting and diagnosing the breast cancer. This lay more importance to the contribution and efficiency of RS theory in the field of computational biology.},

abstract = {Cancer is a collection of diseases that involves growing abnormal cells with the potential to invade or spread to the body. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. A method for 5-year breast cancer recurrence prediction is presented in this manuscript. Clinicopathologic characteristics of 579 breast cancer patients (recurrence prevalence of 19.3{\%}) were analyzed and discriminative features were selected using statistical feature selection methods. They were further refined by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as the inputs of the classification system with ensemble learning (Bagged Decision Tree: BDT). The proper combination of selected categorical features and also the weight (importance) of the selected interval-measurement-scale features were identified by the PSO algorithm. The performance of HPBCR (hybrid predictor of breast cancer recurrence) was assessed using the holdout and 4-fold cross-validation. Three other classifiers namely as supported vector machines, DT, and multilayer perceptron neural network were used for comparison. The selected features were diagnosis age, tumor size, lymph node involvement ratio, number of involved axillary lymph nodes, progesterone receptor expression, having hormone therapy and type of surgery. The minimum sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy of HPBCR were 77{\%}, 93{\%}, 95{\%} and 85{\%}, respectively in the entire cross-validation folds and the hold-out test fold. HPBCR outperformed the other tested classifiers. It showed excellent agreement with the gold standard (i.e. the oncologist opinion after blood tumor marker and imaging tests, and tissue biopsy). This algorithm is thus a promising online tool for the prediction of breast cancer recurrence.},

abstract = {Evaluation of survival models to predict cancer patient prognosis is one of the most important areas of emphasis in cancer research. A binary classification approach has difficulty directly predicting survival due to the characteristics of censored observations and the fact that the predictive power depends on the threshold used to set two classes. In contrast, the traditional Cox regression approach has some drawbacks in the sense that it does not allow for the identification of interactions between genomic features, which could have key roles associated with cancer prognosis. In addition, data integration is regarded as one of the important issues in improving the predictive power of survival models since cancer could be caused by multiple alterations through meta-dimensional genomic data including genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Here we have proposed a new integrative framework designed to perform these three functions simultaneously: (1) predicting censored survival data; (2) integrating meta-dimensional omics data; (3) identifying interactions within/between meta-dimensional genomic features associated with survival. In order to predict censored survival time, martingale residuals were calculated as a new continuous outcome and a new fitness function used by the grammatical evolution neural network (GENN) based on mean absolute difference of martingale residuals was implemented. To test the utility of the proposed framework, a simulation study was conducted, followed by an analysis of meta-dimensional omics data including copy number, gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression data in breast cancer retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). On the basis of the results from breast cancer dataset, we were able to identify interactions not only within a single dimension of genomic data but also between meta-dimensional omics data that are associated with survival. Notably, the predictive power of our best meta-dimensional model was 73{\%} which outperformed all of the other models conducted based on a single dimension of genomic data. Breast cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease and the high levels of genomic diversity within/between breast tumors could affect the risk of therapeutic responses and disease progression. Thus, identifying interactions within/between meta-dimensional omics data associated with survival in breast cancer is expected to deliver direction for improved meta-dimensional prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer type attacking women worldwide. Also, breast cancer has been phenotypically classified into five subtypes. Each subtype group has unique characteristics that demonstrate the heterogeneity present within the breast cancer tumour. In 2012, the American Association for Cancer Research provided a population based molecular integrative clusters for the METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium) dataset, resulting in ten subtypes. Previous work on the METABRIC dataset used only gene expression data to figure out the effective genes for each subtype, without applying integration to benefit from all data sources. The objective of this paper is to present a breast cancer subtype classification model that applies feature fusion on the METABRIC datasets, namely clinical, gene expression, Copy Number Aberrations (CNA), Copy Number Variations (CNV), and histopathological images. State-of-the-art machine learning classifiers were applied on different data profiles, including Linear-SVM, Radial-SVM, Random Forests (RF), Ensemble SVM (E-SVM), and Boosting. The highest accuracy achieved for IntClust subtyping was 88.36{\%} using Linear-SVM, applied on the data profile with features fused from the clinical, gene expression, CNA, and CNV datasets, with a Jaccard and Dice scores of 0.802 and 0.8835, respectively. On the other hand, for the Pam50 subtyping, an accuracy of 97.1{\%} was achieved, Jaccard score ranging from 0.9439 to 0.9472, and Dice score of 0.971, using Linear-SVM and E-SVM classifiers, with several data profiles that include features from histopathological images. Conclusively, the significance of our study is to validate that using feature fusion from various METABRIC datasets improves breast cancer subtypes classification performance. Moreover, histopathological images give promising results on Pam50 subtypes, and it is expected to improve the accuracy for IntClust subtyping when applied on a higher population.},

abstract = {Summary
DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways modulate cancer risk, progression, and therapeutic response. We systematically analyzed somatic alterations to provide a comprehensive view of DDR deficiency across 33 cancer types. Mutations with accompanying loss of heterozygosity were observed in over 1/3 of DDR genes, including TP53 and BRCA1/2. Other prevalent alterations included epigenetic silencing of the direct repair genes EXO5, MGMT, and ALKBH3 in ∼20{\%} of samples. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was present at varying frequency in many cancer types, most notably ovarian cancer. However, in contrast to ovarian cancer, HRD was associated with worse outcomes in several other cancers. Protein structure-based analyses allowed us to predict functional consequences of rare, recurrent DDR mutations. A new machine-learning-based classifier developed from gene expression data allowed us to identify alterations that phenocopy deleterious TP53 mutations. These frequent DDR gene alterations in many human cancers have functional consequences that may determine cancer progression and guide therapy.},

abstract = {Genomic profiling of cancer studies has generated comprehensive gene expression patterns for diverse phenotypes. Computational methods which employ transcriptomics datasets have been proposed to model gene expression data. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) have been used for modeling time series datasets and for the inference of regulatory networks. Furthermore, cancer classification through DBN-based approaches could reveal the importance of exploiting knowledge from statistically significant genes and key regulatory molecules. Although microarray datasets have been employed extensively by several classification methods for decision making, the use of new knowledge from the pathway level has not been addressed adequately in the literature in terms of DBNs for cancer classification. In the present study, we identify the genes that act as regulators and mediate the activity of transcription factors that have been found in all promoters of our differentially expressed gene sets. These features serve as potential priors for distinguishing tumor from normal samples using a DBN-based classification approach. We employed three microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public functional repository and performed differential expression analysis. Promoter and pathway analysis of the identified genes revealed the key regulators which influence the transcription mechanisms of these genes. We applied the DBN algorithm on selected genes and identified the features that can accurately classify the samples into tumors and controls. Both accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were high for the gene sets comprising of the differentially expressed genes along with their master regulators (accuracy: 70.8{\%}–98.5{\%}; AUC: 0.562–0.985).},

abstract = {Background and objective
Breast cancer is a leading cause of death from cancer for females. The high mortality rate of breast cancer is largely due to the complexity among invasive breast cancer and its significantly varied clinical outcomes. Therefore, improving the accuracy of breast cancer survival prediction has important significance and becomes one of the major research areas. Nowadays many computational models have been proposed for breast cancer survival prediction, however, most of them generate the predictive models by employing only the genomic data information and few of them consider the complementary information from pathological images.

In our study, we introduce a novel method called GPMKL based on multiple kernel learning (MKL), which efficiently employs heterogeneous information containing genomic data (gene expression, copy number alteration, gene methylation, protein expression) and pathological images. With above heterogeneous features, GPMKL is proposed to execute feature fusion which is embedded in breast cancer classification.
Results
Performance analysis of the GPMKL model indicates that the pathological image information plays a critical part in accurately predicting the survival time of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared with other existing breast cancer survival prediction methods, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework with pathological images performs remarkably better than the existing survival prediction methods.
Conclusions
All results performed in our study suggest that the usefulness and superiority of GPMKL in predicting human breast cancer survival.},

abstract = {Summary
Hippo signaling has been recognized as a key tumor suppressor pathway. Here, we perform a comprehensive molecular characterization of 19 Hippo core genes in 9,125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types using multidimensional “omic” data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identify somatic drivers among Hippo genes and the related microRNA (miRNA) regulators, and using functional genomic approaches, we experimentally characterize YAP and TAZ mutation effects and miR-590 and miR-200a regulation for TAZ. Hippo pathway activity is best characterized by a YAP/TAZ transcriptional target signature of 22 genes, which shows robust prognostic power across cancer types. Our elastic-net integrated modeling further reveals cancer-type-specific pathway regulators and associated cancer drivers. Our results highlight the importance of Hippo signaling in squamous cell cancers, characterized by frequent amplification of YAP/TAZ, high expression heterogeneity, and significant prognostic patterns. This study represents a systems-biology approach to characterizing key cancer signaling pathways in the post-genomic era.},

abstract = {Gene expression analysis plays a significant role for providing molecular insights in cancer. Various genetic and epigenetic factors (being dealt under multi-omics) affect gene expression giving rise to cancer phenotypes. A recent growth in understanding of multi-omics seems to provide a resource for integration in interdisciplinary biology since they altogether can draw the comprehensive picture of an organism's developmental and disease biology in cancers. Such large scale multi-omics data can be obtained from public consortium like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and several other platforms. Integrating these multi-omics data from varied platforms is still challenging due to high noise and sensitivity of the platforms used. Currently, a robust integrative predictive model to estimate gene expression from these genetic and epigenetic data is lacking. In this study, we have developed a deep learning-based predictive model using Deep Denoising Auto-encoder (DDAE) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) that can quantitatively capture how genetic and epigenetic alterations correlate with directionality of gene expression for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). The DDAE used in the study has been trained to extract significant features from the input omics data to estimate the gene expression. These features have then been used for back-propagation learning by the multilayer perceptron for the task of regression and classification. We have benchmarked the proposed model against state-of-the-art regression models. Finally, the deep learning-based integration model has been evaluated for its disease classification capability, where an accuracy of 95.1{\%} has been obtained.},

abstract = {This research proposes a novel genetic algorithm-based online gradient boosting (GAOGB) model for incremental breast cancer (BC) prognosis. The development of clinical information collection technologies has brought in increasingly large amounts of stream data for BC research. Traditional batch learning models have shown limitations in: (1) real-time prognosis accuracy from losing the information of incremental changes of a patient's pathological condition by time; (2) high redundancy due to the time required to retrain models every time new data are received. Online boosting is an efficient technique for learning from data streams. However, difficulties in parameter assignment and the lack of adaptiveness for batch learning base learners can degrade the performances of typical online boosting algorithms. The main objective of this research is to propose an incremental learning model for BC survivability prediction. To render a boosting algorithm with superiority in global optimal parameters, the genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated to an online gradient boosting scenario at the parameter selection phase, enabling real-time optimization. To enhance adaptiveness, an adaptive linear regressor is adopted as the base learner with minimal computational efforts, and updated in symphony with the online boosting model. The proposed GAOGB model is comprehensively evaluated on the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program breast cancer dataset in terms of accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, retraining time, and variation at each iteration. Experimental results show that the proposed GAOGB model achieves statistically outstanding online learning effectiveness. With a highest 28{\%} improvement on testing accuracy over its base learners, outperforming current state-of-art online learning methods, and approximating batch learning boosting algorithms, the GAOGB algorithm validates the impact of parameter, adaptiveness and convergence in devising practical online learning algorithms. The proposed GAOGB model demonstrates potential for practical incremental breast cancer prognosis, promising a combination of training effectiveness and efficiency.},
