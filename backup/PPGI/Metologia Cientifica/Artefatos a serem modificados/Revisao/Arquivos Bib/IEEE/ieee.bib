abstract={Breast cancer is the second most exposed cancer in the world. When the growth of breast tissues are out of control is called breast cancer. Breast cancer prediction and prognosis are major challenge to medical community. Breast cancer are prominent cause of death for women. Recurrence of cancer is the biggest fears for cancer patient and this can affect their quality of life. The aim of this research is to predict breast cancer from cancer features with high accuracy. The breast cancer Coimbra dataset taken from UCI (University of California Irvine) [1], [5] to build a most efficient ensemble machine learning models. The major steps we follow, here are feature scaling, cross validation and various ensemble machine learning models with bagging technique. Decision tree and KNN gives highest 100% accuracy. Decision tree model gives 100% accuracy if we split train-test dataset in ratio of 90:10 and also used 300 bags of trees. KNN gives maximum accuracy 100%, for k= 1 to 7 in seven loops with 90% is train data and 10% is test data. Here k is the nearest neighbors. And we also evaluate its prediction by accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report. Our aim is to build a most accurate and efficient machine learning model. So as prediction result, patient can take treatment on the early stage.},

abstract={Breast cancer is the second most common cancer, which accounts for about 16% of all female cancers and 18.2% of all cancer deaths worldwide including both males and females. Therefore, accurate prognosis prediction of breast cancer is one of the most crucial works in follow-up treatment. In this work, we introduced a novel deep learning (DL) method named D-SVM for the prediction of human breast cancer prognosis. D-SVM was a supervised feature extraction and classification method integrating deep neural network and traditional support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This novel algorithm effectively learned hierarchical and abstract representation from raw input data and successfully integrated traditional classification method. Our experimental results clearly indicated that the proposed method could enable us to train a model that yielded reasonably good performance than traditional classification approaches on a small-scale gene expression dataset for breast cancer.},

abstract={Accurate cancer patient prognosis stratification is essential for oncologists to recommend proper treatment plans. Deep learning models are capable of providing good prediction power for such stratification. The main challenge is that only a limited number of labeled patients are available for cancer prognosis. To overcome this, we proposed Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-based Deep Adversarial Data Augmentation (wDADA) that leverages generative adversarial networks to perform data augmentation and assist in model training. We used the proposed framework to train our model for predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) of breast cancer patients from the METABRIC dataset. We found that wDADA achieved 0.6726± 0.0278, 0.7538±0.0328, and 0.6507 ±0.0248 in terms of accuracy, AUC, and concordance index in predicting 5-year DSS, respectively, which is comparable to our previously proposed Bimodal model (accuracy: 0.6889±0.0159; AUC: 0.7546± 0.0183; concordance index: 0.6542±0.0120), which needs careful calibration and extensive search on pre-trained network architectures. The flexibility of the proposed wDADA allows us to incorporate it with ensemble learning and semi-supervised learning to further improve performance. Our results indicate that it is possible to utilize generative adversarial networks to train deep models in medical applications, wherein only limited data are available.},

abstract={The most common cancer among women is breast cancer. Around 12% of women are affected by it all over the world. Recurrent breast cancer is a term used for breast cancer which returns even after a successful treatment. This research aims to use Machine learning to detect and predict the recurrence of breast cancer; and compare all the models by using different metrics like accuracy, precision, etc. The models built can help predict the recurrence of breast cancer effectively. All the models are built using the Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer Dataset(WPBC). The models built are Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, which was build by using RBF Kernel and Leave-One-Out(K-fold Cross-Validation) and Decision Tree using metrics like Gini Index, Entropy and Information Gain.

abstract={Breast MRI is frequently being used for diagnosing breast cancer among the populations at high risk and is also used to evaluate up to what stage of cancer the diagnosis has been made. Although it is difficult to justify the daily use of MRI in the cases of the people recently diagnosed with cancer, the advantage of breast MRI has to be dominant over the biopsies suggested on the basis of findings from MRI. Now, the challenge lies in identifying those patients for whom, breast MRI is carried out and further causes effect on preoperative planning and thus causes a serious effect on the medical outcomes. Gene expression profiling has actually identified a number of unique subtypes of molecules for breast cancer that keeps on varying in the prognosis. There are five important molecular subtypes of breast cancer which are based on the genes that are expressed by cancer-causing tissues such as Luminal-A, Luminal-B, Triple negative basal-like, HER2 enriched, and Nominal. Once the appropriate subtype has been predicted it will help in treating cancer. Thus, the prediction of an accurate molecular subtype of breast cancer plays an important role. Through our study, we found that usage of Automated Machine Learning comes out to be the most efficient way in predicting the molecular subtypes even without increasing our dataset. We implemented BOHB (Bayesian Optimization Hyperband) which helps in optimizing the values of hyperparameters including learning rate, activation function, and optimizer.},

abstract={Due to the prevailing lifestyle, reduced interest in mother feeding, lack of physical activities, exposure to radiations, and various forms of pollution, humans are prone to a deadly disease called cancer. Among different categories of cancer, breast cancer is affecting the women community very severely. Hence, the prediction of breast cancer in its earlier stage has become a crucial one in order to prevent from the loss of lives. At this juncture, various Machine Learning (ML) models can be trained for the diagnosis and prognosis of such disease. Nevertheless, owing to the presence of missing values and inefficient features in the dataset, the prediction accuracy of those models will get reduced. Hence, this paper strives to show that when ML classification algorithms are trained with datasets that are properly pre-processed with imputation of unknown values and selection of suitable features using feature selection techniques, the prediction accuracy can be improved.The experimental results on breast cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness by means of using KNN imputation method and feature engineering with feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination(RFE) and Correlation based Feature Selection(CFS) method with 94.63% and 98.05% of accuracy. It could be concluded from the experimental results that the proposed approach can also be used for other medical diagnosis problems.},

abstract={Due to breast cancer, a number of women die every year. With an early diagnosis, breast cancer can be cured. Prognosis and early detection of cancer types have become a necessity in cancer research. Thus, a reliable and accurate system is required for the classification of benign and malignant tumor types of breast cancer. This paper explores a supervised machine learning model for classification of malignant and benign tumor types from Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset retrieved from UCI machine learning repository. The dataset has 458 (65.50%) of benign data and 241 (34.50%) of malignant data, the total of 699 instances, 11 features and 10 attributes. Random Forest (RF) ensemble learning method is implemented with AdaBoost algorithm manifest improved metrics of performance in binary classification between tumor classes. For more accurate estimation of model prediction performance, 10-fold cross-validation is applied. The structure provided accuracy of 98.5714% along with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 96.296% respectively in the testing phase. Matthews Correlation Coefficient is calculated 0.97 which validates of the structure being a pure binary classifier for this work. The proposed structure outperformed conventional RF classifier for classifying tumor types. Additionally, this model enhances the performance of conventional classifiers.},

abstract={Breast cancer is a major threat for middle aged women throughout the world and currently this is the second most threatening cause of cancer death in women. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death. An important fact regarding breast cancer prognosis is to optimize the probability of cancer recurrence. This paper aims at finding breast cancer recurrence probability using different data mining techniques. We also provide a noble approach in order to improve the accuracy of those models. Cancer patient's data were collected from Wisconsin dataset of UCI machine learning Repository. This dataset contained total 35 attributes in which we applied Naive Bayes, C4.5 Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms and calculated their prediction accuracy. An efficient feature selection algorithm helped us to improve the accuracy of each model by reducing some lower ranked attributes. Not only the contributions of these attributes are very less, but their addition also misguides the classification algorithms. After a careful selection of upper ranked attributes we found a much improved accuracy rate for all three algorithms.},
