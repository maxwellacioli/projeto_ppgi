abstract = {Comprehensive understanding of intratumor heterogeneity requires identification of molecular markers, which are capable of differentiating different subpopulations and which also have clinical significance. One important tool that has been addressing this issue is single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNASeq) that allows the quantification of expression profiles of transcripts in individual cells in a population of cancer cells. Using the expression profiles from scRNASeq, current studies conduct analysis to group cells into different subpopulations using clustering algorithms. In this study, we explore scRNASeq cancer data from a different perspective. We focus on scRNASeq data originating from cancer cells pertaining to a particular cancer type, where the cell type or the subpopulation to which each cell belongs is known. We investigate if the “cell type” of a cancer cell can be predicted based on the expression profiles of a small set of transcripts.},

abstract = {In order to develop precision or personalized medicine, identifying new quantitative imaging markers and building machine learning models to predict cancer risk and prognosis has been attracting broad research interest recently. Most of these research approaches use the similar concepts of the conventional computer-aided detection schemes of medical images, which include steps in detecting and segmenting suspicious regions or tumors, followed by training machine learning models based on the fusion of multiple image features computed from the segmented regions or tumors. However, due to the heterogeneity and boundary fuzziness of the suspicious regions or tumors, segmenting subtle regions is often difficult and unreliable. Additionally, ignoring global and/or background parenchymal tissue characteristics may also be a limitation of the conventional approaches. In our recent studies, we investigated the feasibility of developing new computer-aided schemes implemented with the machine learning models that are trained by global image features to predict cancer risk and prognosis. We trained and tested several models using images obtained from full-field digital mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. Study results showed that many of these new models yielded higher performance than other approaches used in current clinical practice. Furthermore, the computed global image features also contain complementary information from the features computed from the segmented regions or tumors in predicting cancer prognosis. Therefore, the global image features can be used alone to develop new case-based prediction models or can be added to current tumor-based models to increase their discriminatory power.},

abstract = {Breast cancer, as one of the most common diseases threatening the women's life, has attracted serious attention of the clinical and biomedical researchers worldwide. The genome-based studies along with their registered GEO datasets are frequent in the literature. Since several methodologies have been developed for analyzing and identifying gene biomarkers, it is necessary to evaluate their robustness. In this study, three well-known biomarker identification methods (i.e., ClusterOne, MCODE, and BioDiscML) were employed in order to identify the potential biomarkers. Then, the methods were ranked and evaluated using nonlinear classification models developed based on the identified sets of biomarkers. A combined BC microarray dataset consisting of GSE124647, GSE124646, and GSE15852 was used as training set, and two test datasets, GSE15852 and GSE25066, were used for the performance measurement of the trained models. The validation of the proposed models was carried out internally (leave-one-out, fivefold and tenfold cross-validation, random sampling, test on training set) and externally (test on test set). The results showed that ClusterOne, MCODE, and BioDiscML tools ranked first, second, and third, respectively, based on the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall metrics. Overall, it can be concluded that the descriptive values of gene biomarkers in terms of their biological aspects that have been determined by a given methodology and the predictive power of the models developed based on the identified gene biomarkers should be considered simultaneously while validating the biomarker identification approaches.},

abstract = {Classifying data samples into their respective categories is a challenging task, especially when the dataset has more features and only a few samples. A robust model is essential for the accurate classification of data samples. The logistic sigmoid model is one of the simplest model for binary classification. Among the various optimization techniques of the sigmoid function, Adam optimization technique iteratively updates network weights based on training data. Traditional Adam optimizer fails to converge model within certain epochs when the initial values for parameters are situated at the gentle region of the error surface. The continuous movement of the convergence curve in the direction of history can overshoot the goal and oscillate back and forth incessantly before converging to the global minima. The traditional Adam optimizer with a higher learning rate collapses after several epochs for the high-dimensional dataset. The proposed Improved Adam (iAdam) technique is a combination of the look-ahead mechanism and adaptive learning rate for each parameter. It improves the momentum of traditional Adam by evaluating the gradient after applying the current velocity. iAdam also acts as the correction factor to the momentum of Adam. Further, it works efficiently for the high-dimensional dataset and converges considerably to the smallest error within the specified epochs even at higher learning rates. The proposed technique is compared with several traditional methods which demonstrates that iAdam is suitable for the classification of high-dimensional data and it also prevents the model from overfitting by effectively handling bias-variance trade-offs.},

Currently, the most popular method of monitoring and diagnoses—in addition to mammography—is carrying out repeated biopsies to locate the tumor further, that may result in loss of breast tissues. This paper presents an effective method of classifying and detecting the masses in mammograms. In the proposed method, we first attain the feature vector pertaining to each mammography image based on Gabor wavelet transform. Then, we performed tenfold cross validation through several experiments, analyzing the data complexity on each fold. We also used some machine learning methods as decision-making stage and achieved mean accuracies above 0.939, mean sensitivities as high as 0.951, and the mean specificities greater than 0.92. Evaluations and comparisons witness the effectiveness of the proposed method for better diagnosis of breast cancer against the known classification techniques developed in mammography. Simplicity, robustness and high accuracy are advantages of the proposed method.},

First post-contrast MRI images were used for 3D segmentation using 3D slicer. A CNN architecture was designed with 14 layers. Residual connections were used in the earlier layers to allow stabilization of gradients during backpropagation. Inception style layers were utilized deeper in the network to allow learned segregation of more complex feature mappings. Extensive regularization was utilized including dropout, L2, feature map dropout, and transition layers. The class imbalance was addressed by doubling the input of underrepresented classes and utilizing a class sensitive cost function. Parameters were tuned based on a 20{\%} validation group. A class balanced holdout set of 40 patients was utilized as the testing set. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with one NVidia Titan X GPU. Seventy-four luminal A, 106 luminal B, 13 HER2+, and 23 basal breast tumors were evaluated. Testing set accuracy was measured at 70{\%}. The class normalized macro area under receiver operating curve (ROC) was measured at 0.853. Non-normalized micro-aggregated AUC was measured at 0.871, representing improved discriminatory power for the highly represented Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes. Aggregate sensitivity and specificity was measured at 0.603 and 0.958. MRI analysis of breast cancers utilizing a novel CNN can predict the molecular subtype of breast cancers.

A total of 30 TNBC patients and 50 age and gender-matched controls of Indian origin were screened for 9,00,000 SNP markers using microarray-based SNP genotyping approach. The initial PLINK association analysis (p {\textless} 0.01, MAF 0.14–0.44, OR 10–24) identified 28 non-synonymous SNPs and one stop gain mutation in the exonic region as possible determinants of TNBC risk. All the 29 SNPs were annotated using ANNOVAR. The interactions between these markers were evaluated using Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. The interactions were in the following order: exm408776 {\textgreater} exm1278309 {\textgreater} rs316389 {\textgreater} rs1651654 {\textgreater} rs635538 {\textgreater} exm1292477. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was performed to construct decision tree useful in predicting TNBC risk. As shown in this analysis, rs1651654 and exm585172 SNPs are found to be determinants of TNBC risk. Artificial neural network model was used to generate the Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), which showed high sensitivity and specificity (AUC-0.94) of these markers. To conclude, among the 9,00,000 SNPs tested, CCDC42 exm1292477, ANXA3 exm408776, SASH1 exm585172 are found to be the most significant genetic predicting factors for TNBC. The interactions among exm408776, exm1278309, rs316389, rs1651654, rs635538, exm1292477 SNPs inflate the risk for TNBC further. Targeted analysis of these SNPs and genes alone also will have similar clinical utility in predicting TNBC.},

abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is the third leading cause of deaths in women globally. In general, histopathology images are recommended for early diagnosis and detailed analysis for BC. Thus, state-of-the-art classification models are required for the early prediction of BC using histopathology images. This study aims to develop an accurate and computationally feasible classification model named Biopsy Microscopic Image Cancer Network (BMIC{\_}Net) to classify BC into eight distinct subtypes through deep learning (DL) and hierarchical classification approach. For experiments, the publicly available dataset BreakHis is used and splitted into training and testing set. Furthermore, data augmentation was performed on training set only and 4096 result-oriented features were extracted through DL. In order to improve the classification performance, feature reduction schemes were experimented to elicit the most discriminative feature subset. Finally, six machine-learning algorithms were analyzed to acquire the best results. The experimental results revealed that BMIC{\_}Net outperformed existing baseline models by obtaining the highest accuracy of 95.48{\%} for first-level classifier and 94.62{\%} and 92.45{\%} for second-level classifiers. Thus, this model can be deployed on a normal desktop machine in any healthcare center of less privileged areas in under-developing countries to serve as second opinion for breast cancer classification.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. We investigated whether changes in large-scale DNA organization (LDO) of tumor epithelial nuclei are an indicator of the aggressiveness of the tumor. We tested our algorithm on a set of 172 duplicates TMA cores samples coming from 95 breast cancer patients. Thirty-five patients died of breast cancer, and 60 were still alive 10 years after surgery. Duplicates cores were used to create training and test set. The TMA slides were stained with Feulgen–thionin and imaged using our in-house high-resolution Imaging system. Automated segmentation of cell nuclei followed by manual selection of intact, in-focus nuclei resulted in an average of 50 cell nuclei per sample available for analysis. Using forward stepwise linear discriminant analysis, a combination of six features that combined linearly gave the best discrimination between the two groups of cells: cells collected from ‘deceased' patients TMA specimens and cells collected from “survivors” patients TMA specimens. Five of these features measure the spatial organization of DNA chromatin. The resulting canonical score is named cell LDO score. A patient LDO score, percentage of cell nuclei with a cell LDO score higher than a predefined cutoff value, was processed for the specimens in the test set, and a cutoff value was defined to classify patients with a low or a high LDO score. Using this binary test, 82.1{\%} of patients were correctly classified are “deceased” or “survivors,” with a specificity of 79{\%} and a sensitivity of 88{\%}. The relative risk of death of an individual with a high LDO score was nine times higher than for a patient with a low LDO score. When testing the combination of LDO score, node status, histological grade, and tumor grade to predict breast cancer survival, LDO was the most significant predictor. LDO classification was also highly associated with survival for only grade 1 and 2 patients as well as for only grade 3 patients. Our result confirms the potential of LDO to measure phenotypic changes associated with more aggressive disease and could be evaluated to identify patients more likely to benefit from adjuvant therapies.},
